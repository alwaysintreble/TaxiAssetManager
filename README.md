# Taxi Asset Manager

A mod allowing for asset replacements for Yellow Taxi Goes Vroom.

Features:
* Allows for swapping the texture on the taxi
* Comes with 4 recolors as examples

How to use:
* Install [Chauffeur](https://github.com/alwaysintreble/Chauffeur)
* Download TaxiAssetManager from [the releases page](https://github.com/alwaysintreble/TaxiAssetManager/releases/latest)
* Unzip TaxiAssetManager to the plugins folder: `\Yellow Taxi Goes Vroom\BepInEx\plugins`

To create custom skins:
* Launch the game at least once with the mod installed; this will cause a new directory, `TaxiSkins`, to be created in
  the game directory.
* Create a new directory inside the `TaxiSkins` directory with the name of your skin.
* Create images to be used for the skin. These must be named `TextureTaxiGlassAnim` 1-8, and must be either `.png` or
`.jpg`. Check the included skins for examples. For a guide on how to rip the assets for yourself to edit, see https://discord.com/channels/1003967509348765787/1232756667662336090/1232756694027599914
